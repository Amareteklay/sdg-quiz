# SDG Quiz
SDG stands for Sustainable Development Goals. SDG Quiz is a command-line python application that helps users to take a quiz about the basics of the UN SDGs. The UN Agenda 2030 is a comprehensive plan that aims to ensure global sustainable development by 2030.  

By taking the SDG Quiz, individuals can have an idea of **how much they know** the SDGs. This can help them be more mindful in their behaviors and more sustainable in their life styles. Researchers may also want to give their subjects the SDG Quiz, along with other survey questions, to collect data about level of awareness of individuals.

## User goals
- The user of this application wants to take a quiz on the UN's Sustainable Development Goals to know how much they know, both in absolute (one's own performance) and relative terms (relative to others' performance). 
## Owner goals
- The key goal of the owner of the application is to engage users in the Agenda 2030 both through compelling questions and feedback but also through an invitation to read and understand the SDGs. As humans are socially-aware, the owner aims to motivate users by providing them with game statistics to show them their relative performance.

## User stories

- As a user, I want to take a quiz about SDGs to assess my understanding so that I can be more mindful about sustainability.
- As a user, I want to see how others are doing in the quiz so that I can compare my performance to others.
- As a user, I want to read basic facts about the SDGs so that I can refresh my memory.
- As a user, I want to be able to get feedback at each stage of the game so that I can understand if my actions are properly handled by the application.
- As a user, I want to know how many questions there are and how many I have left so that I can expect when the quiz ends.
- As a user, I want to see my results both for each question and overall so that I learn from questions I fail to answer too.
- As a user, I want to be able to choose what to do and be given appropriate feedback when I make mistakes so that I get the best out of the quiz.


## Features implemented

### Main menu

#### Taking the quiz
#### Viewing top scores

#### Reading about SDGs

#### Quit the app



## Features not implemented
It is worth mentioning that this quiz can be extended in different directions. One of the cool features that can be added in the future is adding survey questions at the end that users can voluntarily fill that out so that the survey data and the snwers and scores (which are already recorded) can be used for research.


I used the aforementioned user stories as well as the learning outcomes of this project to guide me through the inception, implementation and deployment process.

### Features to be added
For research purposes, an admin part is possible. I have included a sheet to record answers. If need be there, one can add survey questions in the end and study who answered which question and what patterns are there between answers and user profile.

- I used [ASCII Art Library For Python](https://pypi.org/project/art/) to create ASCII art
- Lucid chart to sketch flow charts
- Google sheets to store data
